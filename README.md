📊 Visualizing Volunteering Opportunities in Saudi Arabia (Q1 2023) with Power BI 💡

Excited to share a recent project I worked on, visualizing data on volunteering opportunities in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia during the first quarter of 2023. Using Power BI, I was able to create interactive dashboards that provide valuable insights into the various volunteering opportunities available across the country.

🛠️ Tools & Technologies:
- Power BI: For creating interactive dashboards and visualizations.
- Data Sources: Saudi Open Data portal.


 🌟 Aims:
- The visualizations help organizations better understand the volunteering landscape in Saudi Arabia and allocate resources more effectively.
- Individuals interested in volunteering can easily find opportunities that align with their interests and skills.
